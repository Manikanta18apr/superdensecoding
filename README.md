# superdensecoding
Simulate a superdense coding protocol where two classical bits  are transmitted using a single qubit with prior entanglement<br>
Imagine sending two classical bits of information using just one qubit. That’s not science fiction — that’s Superdense Coding, one of the most powerful protocols in quantum communication. We built an interactive simulator that demonstrates this breakthrough concept, making quantum mechanics tangible and easy to understand.
